When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate on a project, get ideas, feedback, help.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

So you can specify what you want to pull and so you know what's
been pulled. If there are multiple people working on a project
it's good to know what's being loaded into your local repository.
