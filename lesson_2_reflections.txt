What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

You use git init to bring in .git repo with no commits initially in it.
You need it to track development history a file that you're updating.

This is an example of something that I think I forgot to add. Something about
the difference between a repo, a WD, and the stageing area and how the stageing
area is useful for including exactly what you want in your commit.

So, I just saved without adding a commit message and the file was updated.

Now I'm adding a commit message.

This is going to add another commit with blablabla nothing important
just for funsies.
